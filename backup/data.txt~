gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256
Another type of cryptographic solution provided by Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) is symmetric-key encryption, also known as block cipher based encryption.
The ciphers used for symmetric-key encryption use the same key for both the encryption and decryption stages.
This key is also called a shared secret.
The reason the ciphers are called block ciphers is because the data to be encrypted is encrypted in chunks or blocks.
If you just want to encrypt some files or data and don't want to set up a key pair (required for asymmetric encryption and digital signatures), then symmetric-key based cryptography is your answer.
Below, we'll cover several of the available ciphers including: AES256, TWOFISH, and CAMELLIA256.
